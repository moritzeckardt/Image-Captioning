             provide more safety on the road. For this reason, we were eager to develop an application in the field of labeling. Through the project, we hoped to be 
             able to practically apply our theoretical foundations and expand our knowledge in the field of screen recognition. and to expand our knowledge in the 
             field of image recognition and labeling.""")

             Finding a model that had already been trained, as well as fine-tuning and transferring it to the Streamlit application, proved in some cases to be
             more difficult than expected in some cases. Nonetheless, we can now present a relatively good model that can 
             present some features to engage the user in the application.""")

            For research, Google Schoolar and Papers with code were of course of great importance. As for software, we settled on.
            Kaggle, TensorFlow, Pycharm, and Jupyter, among others. Concrete libraries we used for implementation were Streamlit and Torch, of course.

             preparing the data, training a model, and finally evaluating it. Of course, there were always problems along the way, which we solved together.""")
